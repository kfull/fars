This is an R package designed to analyze data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

It was created in the context of the Coursera course [Building R Packages] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages/home).
